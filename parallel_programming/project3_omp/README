THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS,
AND ALSO ABOUT THE FORMAT WHICH THE INPUT FILES MUST HAVE.

1. COMPILING THE PROGRAMS
The various programs can be compiled using the Makefile in this directory. (This requires an installed copy of GNU Make)
To compile all the programs, type "make all" or "make".
Each program can also be compiled separately by typing "make <name_of_c_file>" (read the Makefile for clarification)

2. FORMAT OF INPUT FILES AND HOW TO CREATE THEM
Input files for testing the matrix-matrix multiplication program 
can be created by running the program "./create_test_matrix_matrix_file".

    2.1. INPUT FILE FOR MATRIX-MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
    "./create_test_matrix_matrix_file" creates one file named "matrix1.txt" with information about two matrices.
    The file is formatted like this:

        2 3
        1 2 3
        4 5 6

        3 2
        1 2
        3 4
        5 6

    Where the first line contains the number of rows and columns of the first matrix,
    and the fourth line contains the number of rows and columns of the second matrix.
    (If the first matrix does not have two rows, the information about the second
    matrix will obviously not be on line four)

    !!!!! THE INPUT FILE FOR THE MATRIX-MATRIX MULTIPLICATION PROGRAM HAS TO BE FORMATTED LIKE THIS FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK !!!!!

3. RUNNING THE PROGRAM
How to run the program that generates input files is described in section 2.

    3.1 MATRIX-MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
    The matrix-matrix multiplication program can be compiled as described in section 1.
    When the program is compiled, it can be run by typing:

        ./parallel_matrix_matrix_multiply 1

    Where the number after the program name indicates how many threads should be used by the program.
    It is important that there exists a file named "matrix1.txt" in the same directory as the program for it to run.
    It must also be formatted correctly (look at section 2) for the program to behave correctly.

4. OUTPUT FILES
The matrix-matrix multiplication program creates 7 output files; one for each type of parallel matrix-matrix multiplication
it carries out. The files are named "<name>_matrix_matrix_result.txt", where <name> is the name I gave the corresponding
type of matrix-matrix multiplication. <name> can be "ijk", "jik", "ikj", "jki", "kij", "kji" and "nested".
All of the files are formatted like this:

    1 2 3 2 5 6
    3 2 5 1 2 5
    5 6 3 2 1 4
    5 3 2 1 4 5
    6 3 2 5 4 5

Where the whole file consists of just the resulting matrix from the multiplication.
