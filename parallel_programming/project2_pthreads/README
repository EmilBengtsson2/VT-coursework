THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS,
AND ALSO ABOUT THE FORMAT WHICH THE INPUT FILES MUST HAVE.

1. COMPILING THE PROGRAMS
The various programs can be compiled using the Makefile in this directory. (This requires an installed copy of GNU Make)
To compile all the programs, type "make all" or "make".
Each program can also be compiled separately by typing "make <name_of_c_file>" (read the Makefile for clarification)

2. FORMAT OF INPUT FILES AND HOW TO CREATE THEM
Input files for testing the matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication programs 
can be created by running the programs "./create_test_matrix_matrix_file" and "./create_test_matrix_vector_pair".

    2.1. INPUT FILES FOR MATRIX-VECTOR MULTIPLICATION
    "./create_test_matrix_vector_pair" creates two files named "matrix.txt" and "vector.txt" with information
    about the created vector and matrix respectively.
    "matrix.txt" is formatted like this:

        5 6
        1 2 3 2 5 6
        3 2 5 1 2 5
        5 6 3 2 1 4
        5 3 2 1 4 5
        6 3 2 5 4 5

    Where the first line contains the number of rows and columns of the matrix.
    "vector.txt" is formatted like this:

        1 6
        1 2 3 6 5 4

    Where the first line contains the number of rows and columns of the vector.

    !!!!! THE INPUT FILES FOR THE MATRIX-VECTOR MULTIPLICATION PROGRAM HAS TO BE FORMATTED LIKE THIS FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK !!!!!

    2.2. INPUT FILE FOR MATRIX-MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
    "./create_test_matrix_matrix_file" creates one file named "matrix1.txt" with information about two matrices.
    The file is formatted like this:

        2 3
        1 2 3
        4 5 6

        3 2
        1 2
        3 4
        5 6

    Where the first line contains the number of rows and columns of the first matrix,
    and the fourth line contains the number of rows and columns of the second matrix.
    (If the first matrix does not have two rows, the information about the second
    matrix will obviously not be on line four)

    !!!!! THE INPUT FILE FOR THE MATRIX-MATRIX MULTIPLICATION PROGRAM HAS TO BE FORMATTED LIKE THIS FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK !!!!!

3. RUNNING THE PROGRAMS
How to run the programs that generate input files is described in section 2.

    3.1. MATRIX-VECTOR MULTIPLICATION
    The matrix vector multiplication program can be compiled as described in section 1.
    When the program is compiled, it can be run by typing:

        ./parallel_matrix_vector_multiply 1

    Where the number after the program name indicates how many threads should be used by the program.
    It is important that there exists one file named "matrix.txt" and one file named "vector.txt" in the same
    directory as the program for it to run. They must also be formatted correctly (look at section 2)
    for the program to behave correctly.

    3.2 MATRIX-MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
    The matrix vector multiplication program can be compiled as described in section 1.
    When the program is compiled, it can be run by typing:

        ./parallel_matrix_matrix_multiply 1

    Where the number after the program name indicates how many threads should be used by the program.
    It is important that there exists a file named "matrix1.txt" in the same directory as the program for it to run.
    It must also be formatted correctly (look at section 2) for the program to behave correctly.

    3.3. SEQUENTIAL MATRIX-VECTOR AND MATRIX-MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
    To perform sequential matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication you can run the
    parallel versions of these algorithms on only one thread
    ("./parallell_matrix_matrix_multiply 1" or "./parallel_matrix_vector_multiply 1").
    How to run the parallel verisions of the programs is described in section 3.1 and 3.2.

4. OUTPUT FILES
Both programs create an output file with the result of the matrix-vector or matrix-matrix multiplication
in it. The output file from the matrix-vector multiplication program is named "matrix_vector_result.txt"
and the output file from the matrix-matrix multiplication program is named "matrix_matrix_result.txt".
The files are formatted like this:

    1 2 3 2 5 6
    3 2 5 1 2 5
    5 6 3 2 1 4
    5 3 2 1 4 5
    6 3 2 5 4 5

or this:

    6
    5
    4
    5
    5

Where the whole file consists of just the resulting matrix or vector from the multiplication.
